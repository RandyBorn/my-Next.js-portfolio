        I am 26 years old and from Oberhausen. After completing my training as a
        glass processing mechanic, I discovered my passion for web development.
        I am currently training as a Fullstack Web Developer at the Digital
        Career Institute in Berlin. I work with modern technologies like React,
        Node.js, MongoDB, and Tailwind CSS. I enjoy solving problems
        analytically and working in teams.
